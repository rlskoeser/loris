Resolving Identifiers
=====================

### `SimpleFSResolver`

This supplied implementation just unescapes the identifier and tacks a constant path onto the front. e.g. if `ident = 01%2F02%2F0001.jp2` and in the config file:

```ini
[resolver]
impl = 'loris.resolver.SimpleFSResolver'
src_img_root=/usr/local/share/images
```

then `app.resolver.resolve(ident)` will return 

```
/usr/local/share/images/01/02/0001.jp2
```

### `SimpleHTTPResolver`

#### Main Configuration

This supplied implementation allows one to resolve identifiers against a HTTP source. This resolver requires a variable of "cache_root" be specified (the location to locally cache retrieved images) and that either "source_prefix" and/or "uri_resolvable" is configured.

A sample config of this resolver might be:

```ini
[resolver]
impl = 'loris.resolver.SimpleHTTPResolver'
source_prefix='https://<server>/fedora/objects/'
source_suffix='/datastreams/accessMaster/content'
cache_root='/usr/local/share/images/loris'
user='<if needed else remove this line>'
pw='<if needed else remove this line>'
```

Another sample configuration assuming one wishes to use URIs:

```ini
[resolver]
impl = 'SimpleHTTPResolver'
uri_resolvable=True
cache_root='/usr/local/share/images/loris'
```

A full configuration sample that shows all the options and their defaults are:

```ini
[resolver]
impl = 'SimpleHTTPResolver'
source_prefix=''
source_suffix=''
uri_resolvable=False
head_resolvable=False #DO set this to true if using Fedora Commons 3.8 or later. Earlier versions have a bug for a head response.
default_format=None #Set this if your HTTP server doesn't populate content-response. An example value might be "jp2".
user=None
pw=None
cache_root='<must be configured>'
```

#### Required Other Configurations

Additionally, please note the following must also exist if the "enable_caching" is True and be configured to be owned by the loris user. While the cache_root above with the larger derivatives can be on a NAS, these following must likely be stored on the local server file system to avoid problems (they are somewhat small however):

```ini
[img.ImageCache]
cache_dp = '/var/cache/loris/img' # rwx
cache_links = '/var/cache/loris/links' # rwx

[img_info.InfoCache]
cache_dp = '/var/cache/loris/info' # rwx
```

### `Creating Your Own`

See `resolver._AbstractResolver` for details. Note that any properties you add in the `[resolver.Resolver]` section will be in the `self.config` dictionary as long as you subclass `_AbstractResolver`.
